“Chaotic Call Centre” is a busy company that collects feedback from customers who call in to report on the performance of several telecommunication companies. These calls are in response to random surveys that are conducted throughout Australia.

The company would like a way of storing feedback responses in a way that is not easily readable, and would prefer to use binary files rather than a traditional database solution.

This program has only 1 version, version 1: Release.
